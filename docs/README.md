# write

**The future of book creation tooling**

A scaffolding tool that creates professional book projects with LaTeX typesetting, Git version control, and automated CI/CD publishing pipelines.

## What This Tool Does

`write` sets up the infrastructure for serious book writing by creating a complete project with:

- üìÅ **Project scaffolding** - Organized directory structure for LaTeX books
- üîÑ **Git repository** - Initialized with proper `.gitignore` and structure
- üöÄ **GitHub integration** - Repository creation and CI/CD setup
- ‚ö° **Automated builds** - GitHub Actions to compile PDFs on every commit
- üìö **LaTeX templates** - Professional book layouts ready to use

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @demccormack/write
```

### Create a New Book Project

```bash
# Create and scaffold a complete book project
write new "My Amazing Book"

# This creates a local directory and GitHub repo with:
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-amazing-book/
# ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chapters/          # LaTeX chapter files
# ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/            # Images, figures, etc.
# ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/         # LaTeX document classes
# ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/ # CI/CD for PDF generation
# ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore         # LaTeX-specific ignores
# ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tex           # Main document file
# ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ book.toml          # Project configuration
```

### What You Do Next

1. **Edit in your preferred LaTeX editor** (TeXStudio, VS Code, Overleaf, etc.)
2. **Commit changes to Git** - every idea, immortalized in your git log
3. **Collaborate via pull requests** - built-in review process
4. **Download PDFs from GitHub Actions** - share early previews with interested parties

## Roadmap Features

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This tool is in early development. The following features are planned:

- [ ] Project scaffolding with conventional directory structure
- [ ] GitHub repository creation and setup
- [ ] LaTeX template library (academic, fiction, technical)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Automated PDF builds on commit/PR
- [ ] Multiple output formats (PDF, EPUB, HTML)
- [ ] Book configuration management (`book.toml`)
- [ ] Chapter management commands
- [ ] Asset organization helpers
- [ ] **Author monetization support**:
  - [ ] Patreon integration for subscriber-only content
  - [ ] Automated chapter releases for supporters
  - [ ] Supporter acknowledgments in generated books

## Philosophy

This tool **does not** provide a writing interface. Instead, it:

- Creates the foundation for professional book publishing
- Automates the boring infrastructure setup
- Lets you focus on writing, not tooling
- Uses industry-standard tools (Git, GitHub, LaTeX)
- Makes backups an integral part of your writing process
- Enables collaborative workflows via pull requests

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Git (for version control)
- GitHub account (for repository hosting and CI/CD)
- LaTeX editor (TeXStudio, VS Code, Overleaf, or another editor of your choice)

## Future Commands

```bash
# Repository and CI setup
write new "Book Title" --template academic
write publish                    # Create GitHub repo + CI

# Project management
write chapter "Chapter Name"     # Add new chapter file
write build                      # Local PDF build (if LaTeX installed)
write status                     # Git status + build info
```
