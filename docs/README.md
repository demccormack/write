# write

**The future of book creation tooling**

A scaffolding tool that creates professional book projects with LaTeX typesetting, Git version control, and automated CI/CD publishing pipelines.

## What This Tool Does

`write` sets up the infrastructure for serious book writing by creating a complete project with:

- 📁 **Project scaffolding** - Organized directory structure for LaTeX books
- 🔄 **Git repository** - Initialized with proper `.gitignore` and structure
- 🚀 **GitHub integration** - Repository creation and CI/CD setup
- ⚡ **Automated builds** - GitHub Actions to compile PDFs on every commit
- 📚 **LaTeX templates** - Professional book layouts ready to use

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @demccormack/write
```

### Create a New Book Project

<!-- BEGIN AUTO-GENERATED STRUCTURE -->

```bash
write new "My Amazing Book"
```

This creates a local directory with the following structure:

```
my-amazing-book
├── .github
│   ├── copilot-instructions.md
│   └── workflows
│       └── build.yml
├── .gitignore
├── assets
│   ├── figures
│   └── images
├── book.toml
├── chapters
│   └── chapter01.tex
├── main.tex
└── templates

8 directories, 6 files
```

<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED STRUCTURE -->

### What You Do Next

1. **Edit in your preferred LaTeX editor** (TeXStudio, VS Code, Overleaf, etc.)
2. **Commit changes to Git** - every idea, immortalized in your git log
3. **Collaborate via pull requests** - built-in review process
4. **Download PDFs from GitHub Actions** - share early previews with interested parties

## Roadmap Features

> ⚠️ **Note**: This tool is in early development. The following features are planned:

- [ ] Project scaffolding with conventional directory structure
- [ ] GitHub repository creation and setup
- [ ] LaTeX template library (academic, fiction, technical)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Automated PDF builds on commit/PR
- [ ] Multiple output formats (PDF, EPUB, HTML)
- [ ] Book configuration management (`book.toml`)
- [ ] Chapter management commands
- [ ] Asset organization helpers
- [ ] **Author monetization support**:
  - [ ] Patreon integration for subscriber-only content
  - [ ] Automated chapter releases for supporters
  - [ ] Supporter acknowledgments in generated books

## Philosophy

This tool **does not** provide a writing interface. Instead, it:

- Creates the foundation for professional book publishing
- Automates the boring infrastructure setup
- Lets you focus on writing, not tooling
- Uses industry-standard tools (Git, GitHub, LaTeX)
- Makes backups an integral part of your writing process
- Enables collaborative workflows via pull requests

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Git (for version control)
- GitHub account (for repository hosting and CI/CD)
- LaTeX editor (TeXStudio, VS Code, Overleaf, or another editor of your choice)

## Future Commands

```bash
# Repository and CI setup
write new "Book Title" --template academic
write publish                    # Create GitHub repo + CI

# Project management
write chapter "Chapter Name"     # Add new chapter file
write build                      # Local PDF build (if LaTeX installed)
write status                     # Git status + build info
```
